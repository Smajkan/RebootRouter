# RouterReboot

So, recently I am getting frustrated over internet connection, because I sometimes don't have internet access and to bring it back to life I need to perform router reboot.
Sometimes it happens often, so because of it I am automating that stuff...

This also might turn into something bigger, I might will make email sender to my internet provider, etc...
